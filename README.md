I recently re-created a complete responsive website from scratch to enhance my frontend development skills. The project includes modern UI/UX practices, clean layout structure, and fully mobile-friendly design. I implemented responsive behavior across all screen sizes using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and custom media queries.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

Responsive design techniques

CSS Flexbox & Grid

Bootstrap components & customization

Mobile-first approach

Clean and maintainable code structure

Proud of how the design turned out—smooth, fast, and responsive on all devices. 🚀
Feel free to check it out!
